# UFO-Sightings
Developed a unique website that displays various UFO encounters from across the world using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Project Overview 
The town of McMinnville, Oregon, where Dana is from, is well-known for its UFO encounters, and she had the chance to write about it. For this task, we had to navigate through javaScript that provided a lot of data. I intended to display the data as a table first using Javascript. Without any modifications, it was difficult because there was so much data to sort through. Adding more than one filter was a little challenging, but we accepted the challenge. Additionally, we wanted to organize everything into a neat HTML page as we updated the data so that we could fine-tune the findings to support the article and locate necessary data.

## Results
The User can conduct a search using the Date criteria, review the results, and filter the results by State, Country, or even Shape.

## Project Summary
Although Dana's website and dynamic table are functioning as intended, she hoped to offer a more thorough examination of UFO encounters by enabling viewers to simultaneously select for several parameters. We added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape in addition to the date. It would be beneficial to provide a filter button and a clear search criteria choice.
